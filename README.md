# Drone Internship Proposal

Hello Shivam Bhaiya, This is my proposal for the mentioned drone project internship with NDRF.

### My Background and Skills

I am Swayam, first year ECE undergrad student with keen interest in low level development and hardware. Excelling in web and android development, I have started to learn about robotics and UAVs.

I know well enough about drones to get started into building one.
I know quite a few of both drones' hardware and software production.

### Tools I use for Software production

- **Ardupilot** - As the flight controller
- **Gazebo and ROS2** - For 3d simulation of drones
- **QGroundControl** - As a ground control station.

Apart from these, I can adapt with other tools such as PX4 as per the requirements

### My hardware knowledge

About hardware, I have pretty neat insights due to one interaction with a drone enthusiast. I know the following about hardware:

- Wing size and its impact on drone performance
- Importance of structural strength in drone design
- Simulating the structure by applying thrust force on the ends in a simulation before attaching motors
- Selecting required BLDCs based on thrust requirement

I know about different components like flight Controller, ESCs, lidar sensors, GPS, etc.

Although I haven't been able to yet apply my hardware knowledge because of no access to the tools, I am eager to learn and apply it.

### My work in drones

I haven't yet worked on a real drone project but am eager to learn.

~By the end of today, I would have opened a PR in Ardupilot's github repo fixing their install script, which I found problems with yesterday.~
(Somehow I used up old version of the script and was planning on adding support for ubuntu noble, but its already there)
